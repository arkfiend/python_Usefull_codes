Understanding convolutions
The huge math behind convs are so hard to get it, so I made this utility 
(of course it will be improved) to help with this math:
https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html


Dependencies:
[ ] Pytorch 0.4.1
[ ] Python 3.6
[ ] PIL

Try changing the globals values and check your math!
